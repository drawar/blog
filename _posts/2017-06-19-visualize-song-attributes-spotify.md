As a die-hard music fan and a long time Spotify user, I was excited to have discovered Spotify Web API a couple of days ago. I stumbled upon an analysis of Radiohead's gloomiest songs using a combination of audio features scraped from Spotify API and that gave me some great idea to do a statistical analysis of my favorite songs.
<br>
There's hardly a day gone by that I haven't used Spotify for at least half an hour, and that gave Spotify enough information to curate a playlist of my most streamed songs of 2016. The playlist contains 100 songs covering a wide spectrum of genres, and I was quite curious what insights I could gain about my musical preferences.
## Connecting to Spotify Web API
<br>
To get started with Spotify Web API, you have to first set up a developer account [here](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications), register an application, and get your *Client ID* and *Client Secret*, both of which are needed to generate your access token and header value for your HTTP GET request.

{% highlight r %}
library(tidyverse)
library(httr)


clientID = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
clientSecret = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'

# Get header value from Client ID and Client Secret
# Dependencies: tidyverse, httr
get_header_value <- function(client_id, client_secret) {
  token <- POST(
    'https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token',
    accept_json(),
    authenticate(clientID, secret),
    body = list(grant_type = 'client_credentials'),
    encode = 'form',
    verbose()
  ) %>% content %>% .$access_token
  header_value <- paste0('Bearer ', token)
  return(header_value)
}

header_value <- get_header_value(clientID, clientSecret)

{% endhighlight %}
## Getting attributes from songs
<br>
Next, I grabbed the track info for my *Top Songs of 2016* playlist and preprocessed it into a nice tibble (a modern dataframe)

{% highlight r %}

# Get all tracks from Playlist ID and User ID
# Dependencies: tidyverse, httr
get_playlist_tracks <- function(user_id, playlist_id, header_value) {
    tracks <- GET(paste0('https://api.spotify.com/v1/users/', user_id,'/playlists/', playlist_id, '/tracks'),
                  add_headers(Authorization = header_value)) %>% 
      content %>% 
      .$items 
    
    track_names <- sapply(1:length(tracks), function(t) tracks[[t]]$track$name)
    
    ids <- map(1:length(tracks), function(z) tracks[[z]]$track$id) %>% 
      unlist %>% paste0(collapse=',')
    
    res <- GET(paste0('https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-features/?ids=', ids),
               add_headers(Authorization = header_value)) %>% content %>% .$audio_features
    
    df <- unlist(res) %>% 
      matrix(nrow = length(res), byrow = T) %>% 
      as.data.frame(stringsAsFactors = F)
    names(df) <- names(res[[1]])
    df['track_name'] <- track_names
    df <- as_tibble(df) %>% 
    # convert from character to numeric
    mutate_at(c('danceability', 'energy', 'key', 'loudness', 'mode', 'speechiness', 'acousticness',
                  'instrumentalness', 'liveness', 'valence', 'tempo', 'duration_ms', 'time_signature'), funs(as.numeric(gsub('[^0-9.-e]+', '', as.character(.))))) 
    return(df)
}

user_id <- 'spotify'
playlist_id <- '37i9dQZF1CyXyPUy57ueoa'

top_song <- get_playlist_tracks(user_id, playlist_id, header_value)

# exclude irrelevant attributes
top_song <- top_song %>% select(-c(mode, instrumentalness, liveness, time_signature, uri, track_href, analysis_url, type))

# convert durations in ms to s
top_song$duration_ms <- top_song$duration_ms/1000
str(top_song)
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight r %}

The attributes, or *features* in machine learning terminology, are the variables that our mathematical models take into consideration when they try to predict stuff. Our final tibble contain the following attributes for each song:
- **Tempo**: The tempo of the song, measured by beats per minute (BPM).
- **Energy**:The energy of a song, the higher the value, the more energetic.
- **Danceability**: The higher the value, the easier it is to dance to this song.
- **Loudness**: The higher the value, the louder the song (in dB).
- **Valence**: The higher the value, the more positive mood for the song.
- **Length**: The duration of the song, in ms.
- **Acousticness**: The higher the value the more acoustic the song is.
- **Key**: The higher the value the pitchier the song is.
- **Speechiness**: The higher the value the more speech-like the song is i.e. consisted of mainly spoken words.
<br>
# Drumroll, please!
Below you will find a ~~chart~~ interactive chart that show the histogram distribution and a kernel density curve for each attribute.

Overall, the chart gives a descriptive summary of the average song I'd like. It turned out that I tend to listen to music with a tempo of 120 BPM, a little lower than some [common music genres](https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/4525/list-of-average-genre-tempo-bpm-levels/4563#4563). To give you an idea about how slow or fast that is, *The Phantom of the Opera - Single Album Version* also has the same tempo.
<br>
Energy and Danceability seem to be on the high side, though not that far from the average. Mood, denoted by valence, is neutral considering I listened to a healthy mix of upbeat and melancholic songs. Speechiness and acousticness are reasonably low, considering I'm not a big fan of audio commentaries. 
<br>
Average song duration is 232 seconds or 3:52 minutes, a bit longer than the average radio song (3:30). The average key is approximately 5 which, according to [Pitch Class Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class), translate to the key of F. Interestingly, according to an article on the [most popular keys of all music on Spotify](https://insights.spotify.com/us/2015/05/06/most-popular-keys-on-spotify/), songs written in F major/minor only accounts for a meager 8% of all songs.

# So where's the playlist?
I guess it wouldn't make sense to talk all this talk and still the playlist in question is nowhere to be found, so [here is it](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1CyXyPUy57ueoa). In the next post, I'll compare this playlist to some popular playlists (e.g. *Today's Top Hits*) to see how different they are.
