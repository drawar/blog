This is the first project of [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) that I'm currently studying in my free time. The program was well structured and has garnered a lot of positive reviews from past students, so I was excited to jump on this bandwagon.
<br>
In this particular project, I experimented with two of the major parts of the data analysis process: data wrangling and exploratory data analysis. In 2014, Bay Area Bike Share held an [Open Data Challenge](http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/datachallenge-2014) to encourage data analysts to create visualizations based on their open data set. For this project, I used the same data to answer some questions such as:
* When is Bay Area Bike Share used most often?
* What is the most popular route?
* How long, on average, does a trip take?
<br>

The project was done in a Jupyter Notebook, which can be found [here](https://github.com/drawar/data-analyst-nanodegree/blob/master/wk1/dandp0-bikeshareanalysis/Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb).
